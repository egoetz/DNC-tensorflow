[["m :  hi  claire .  how does it feel to be back on campus ? ", "w :  hi  gee .  well  to tell you the truth  i have mixed feelings . ", "m :  oh  why ? ", "w :  i have this great summer job that i really hated to leave i worked at the wild life research center in maryland . ", "m :  that makes sense for a genetic major .  what did you do ?  clean the cages ? ", "w :  this is a wild life center  not a zoo .  this place breeds endangered species and tries to prepare them for life in the wild . ", "m :  you mean the endangered species like the tiger and the panda ? ", "w :  well  endangered species  yes .  but not tigers or pandas .  i work with whooping cranes and sandhill cranes .  i taught the baby crane how to eat and drink  and i help the vets to give medical check - ups . ", "m :  i can see it was hard to leave that job .  but how did you teach a bird how to eat and drink ? ", "w :  we covered ourselves up with cloth and used puppets made out of stuffed crones to show the baby chicks what to do .  then the chicks copied what the puppets did . ", "m :  cloth ?  puppets ?  sounds like fun . ", "w :  it was .  the cloth and puppets are the key tools .  we all covered ourselves up  the scientists  the vets  the junior staff  everybody .  you see  baby cranes will become attached to their caretakers . ", "m :  so if the caretaker is a person  the crane will stay in places where people are . ", "w :  yeah .  and their chances for survival aren ' t very good .  but by covering ourselves and using cloth and puppets the chicks are more likely to seek out other birds rather than people .  and their transition to the wild has a better chance of being successful . ", "m :  a chance of being successful ?  hasn ' t this been done before ? ", "w :  it ' s been done with sandhill cranes and everyone is optimistic about its work with whooping cranes too . ", "m :  if this works  it should increase the number of cranes in the wild . ", "w :  yeah .  it ' s exciting  isn ' t it ? "], [{"question": "why does the woman say she has mixed feeling ?
