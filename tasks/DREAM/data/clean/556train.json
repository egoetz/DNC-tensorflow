[["m :  did you hear about the air crash that occurred in south america recently ?  it was quite a tragic accident ! ", "w :  no  i didn ' t see anything in the news about it .  what happened ? ", "m :  a foreign airliner was attempting to land at night in a mountainous area in argentina and flew into a hill ! ", "w :  that sounds really terrible !  did anyone survive ? ", "m :  no  everyone aboard  including the crew  was killed instantly . ", "w :  what were the circumstances ?  were they bad weather  a fire  or engine failure ? ", "m :  apparently  there were some low clouds in the area  but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers . ", "w :  weren ' t they both speaking in english  the official international aviation language ? ", "m :  yes they were  but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction . ", "w :  how could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident ? ", "m :  the pilots were told to descend to 2 - 2 0 0 0 feet .  the instruction actually meant 2 2 0 0 0 feet  but they thought they heard descend 2 0 0 0 feet .  that ' s a huge difference  and it should have been confirmed  but it was not .  unfortunately  the terrain of the mountains in norweija ascends to 2 0 0 0 feet . ", "w :  so the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then  because they were following the air controllers instructions . ", "m :  sadly enough  yes they did .  it was a really bad mistake .  many people died as a result of the simply understanding .
