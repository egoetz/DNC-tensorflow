[["m :  well  what do you think is the reason most people do so badly at reaching goals ? ", "w :  they lose focus .  everybody ' s life is busy .  there is so much happening in everybody ' s life .  that what happens is they might have a goal and then something will get in the way of that .  maybe their goal is that they want to go on a holiday every year and they put in their leave form with their boss and their boss may ask them to wait for another month and then for another month .  that is  so different things get in their way and people don ' t stand up for their goals .  they don ' t struggle for them .  they let other forces push them around a little bit .  also  a lot of people don ' t set goals ;  they think they do .  but it ' s either a dream of very loose goal .  so when they have to make a decision about a necessary action in their life the goal is so far back in their mind that they don ' t act in its best interest .  also because people will sit down and say  \" oh  here are my goals \"  and forget all about them .  revisiting them every week is a good way .  they stay at the top of your mind so you can take actions based on them .
