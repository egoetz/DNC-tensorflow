", "w :  i ' m sure it was .  it sure looked difficult . ", "m :  yeah  i ' m glad it ' s finished .  hauling the branches to the front for garbage pick up was no fun either . ", "w :  well  i don ' t think you ' re quite finished yet  some of the larger branches fell over into my yard  and i think you should come and get them . ", "m :  listen jane  i don ' t see why i should do that .  you eat all the apples that fall in your yard and you ' ve never complained about that before .

", "m :  well  i guess you ' ll just have to do it yourself jane . ", "w :  patrick  i wish you would reconsider .  we ' ve always gotten along fairly well  but i think you ' re out of line here .  the branches are your responsibility .
