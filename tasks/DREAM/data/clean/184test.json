[["m :  i really appreciate your filling me in on yesterday ' s lecture . ", "w :  no problem .  i thought you might want to go over it together .  and  anyway  it helps me review  hope you ' re feeling better now . ", "m :  i am .  thanks .  so  you said she talked about squid ?  sounds a little strange . ", "w :  well  actually  it was about the evolution of sea life -  - a continuation from last week .  the octopus and the squid descended from earlier creatures with shells .  they survived by shedding their shells -  - somewhere between 2 0 0 and 5 0 0 million years ago . ", "m :  that ' s a pretty long span of time . ", "w :  i know .  that ' s what she said  though .  to be precise :   \" exactly when they emerged is uncertain  .  .  .  and why is still unexplained .  \" ", "m :  some squid are really huge .  can you imagine something that big if it still had a shell ? ", "w :  actually  it ' s because they lost their shells that they could evolve to a bigger size . ", "m :  makes sense .  but some are really huge .  i ' ve read about fishermen that caught squid that weighed over a ton .  did she talk about how that happens ? ", "w :  not really .  but she did mention some unusual cases .  in 1 9 3 3 in new zealand they caught a squid .  .   let ' s see here .  .   it was twenty - two yards long .  its eyes were eighteen inches across .  can you imagine ? ", "m :  reminds me of all those stories of sea monsters . ", "w :  dr .  simpson thinks there are probably even larger ones that haven ' t been found because squid are intelligent and fast -  -  - so they can easily get away from humans .  maybe some of those monster stories are true .
