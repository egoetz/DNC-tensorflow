[["w :  i ' ve been reading about a new snack food .  it ' s made from fish .  have you heard anything about it ? ", "m :  no .  i haven ' t  but i don ' t like fish very much anyway . ", "w :  not to worry .  although it ' s made primarily from fish  it actually doesn ' t have a fishy taste .  in fact  it can be flavored with tomato  cheese  or chocolate for instance", "m :  how can it not taste fishy ?  do you know how this snack food is made ? ", "w :  first the fish is minced and cooked and fermented .  then water and starch are added to make a dough . ", "m :  it sounds awful . ", "w :  actually the dough is very bland al that point  so the flavorings are added to give it some taste . ", "m :  well  it still sounds a little strange .  but i suppose this product will at least be low calorie and high protein .  like a health food . ", "w :  yes  you could call it that .  and it has a long shelf life  so it won ' t spoil quickly .  it is also easy to digest and can ha made from types of fish that usually aren ' t eaten  or from high grade fish by - products ", "m :  mm  have you got any samples ?  i might be willing to try the cheese - flavored variety . ", "w :  no  none of it seems to be available yet .  as i understand it  this fish snack food probably won ' t be in the stores for another couple of years .  so you ' ll have a while to get used to the whole idea . ", "m :  a couple of years  ah ?  it may just take me that long .  but thanks for telling me about it .
