[["m :  today on mind matters  i ' m talking to dr ann winters  an expert on human memory .  .  ann  welcome to the program .  now  i suppose the first question everyone would ask is :  what exactly is human memory ? ", "w :  well  like so many easy questions  the answer isn ' t very simple .  basically  human memory is a compartment in people ' s brains where they store images rather like the hard disc drive in a computer .  and like a hard disc drive  our memories can become infected or even wiped out by accidents .  but the comparison breaks down when we consider that we can train our memories to expand and work better which computers can ' t manage yet . ", "m :  when you talk about memory being infected  do you mean by a disease ? ", "w :  yes .  for instance  people suffering from a physiological disease like alzheimer :  forget things that happened in the past .  and they also forget how to perform simple tasks like tying their shoelaces .  the good news is that brain exercises can help keep the brain young .  research has shown that people who have better educations and more mentally active jobs have a lower risk of developing the disease . ", "m :  and how can someone exercise his brain ?  by thinking a lot ? ", "w :  in a way  yes .  but you can also practice using your memory which not only exercises your brain but also improves you ability to remember things .  unfortunately  a lot of devices in modern life are designed to make sure we don ' t forget things which can make our brains more idle and weaken our memories . ", "m :  can you give us some examples of how to exercise our memories ? ", "w :  sure  there is a very simple technique  although it works better for some people than for others .  when you want to remember something  think of a physical thing it reminds you of .  if i want to remember a date from history  let ' s say  1 0 6 6  the date of the battle of hastings .  i might think that battle reminds me of bottle  so i think of a bottle with the number 1 0 6 6 written on the label .  and i just picture that bottle to myself .
