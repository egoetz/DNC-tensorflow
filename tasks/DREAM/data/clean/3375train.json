[["m :  mary  have you ever wondered why some cultures have more proverbs than others ?  for example  the mayans  the incas  and the north american indian tribes seem to have fewer proverbs than cultures like  the arabians  and the chinese .  i wonder why this is . ", "w :  what would you say about our  .  .  .  our own culture ?  would you say we ' re a culture that ' s rich in proverbs or one that lacks proverbs ? ", "m :  i think we  we have a rich heritage of proverbs  -  the benjamin franklin maxims  proverbs  wise sayings have been handed down to us . ", "w :  well  i think the fact that we ' re no longer creating proverbs today maybe says something  .  .  .  maybe perhaps explains to some extent why proverbs in certain cultures were not as extended or extensive as in other cultures . ", "m :  mm  hmm .  that ' s true .  i wonder why we are not creating as many proverbs as we did in 1700 s and 1800 s .  i agree with you .  i don ' t think there are nearly as many .  i can ' t think of any .  i ' m sure there are some  but i wonder why this is so . ", "w :  yeah  well  i think we all know a great many proverbs .  if we sit down  we can think of some that we can  .  .  .  we can list .  but we don ' t seem to use them to explain things .  we find many times that they ' re used too much and too simple  -  too general .  today we ' re much more sophisticated  you might say  and analytical  and therefore we don ' t use proverbs to explain things the way  say  our grandfathers and parents did . ", "m :  life is too complicated now to just quote a simple proverb to take care of things . ", "w :  right  and maybe to some extent that ' s why the north american indians and the mayans among others don ' t have as many proverbs .  at least there ' s no record of as many proverbs .  since their own culture  .  .  .  their traditions were highly eroded and they were wiped out during this era of change .
