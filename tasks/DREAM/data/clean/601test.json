[["w :  hello  freddie . ", "m :  hello  mary .  how nice to see you again .  how ' s everything going ? ", "w :  fine .  busy these days ? ", "m :  yeah .  with lots of things to do .  would you like to join me for a drink ? ", "w :  ok  thanks . ", "m :  any news recently ? ", "w :  oh  well  i read in the local paper the other day that the government is planning to build an airport here  you know that ? ", "m :  i ' m afraid not . ", "w :  well  my real objection to this idea of a new airport is  is the whole thing is so wasteful  i mean  we know we are currently in fuel crises  we know that we ' ve got to conserve oil and fuel and all the rest of it  and get here the government seems quite deliberately to be encouraging people to   .  .  .  to travel  to use and these jets use a hack of a lot of oil  i mean it takes a ton of oil  a ton of petrol before one of these big jets even takes off . ", "m :  mm .  .  . ", "w :  it seems so completely short - sighted to me .  quite apart from all the ways to the land and so on  i can ' t see  i can ' t see the rationale behind really wanting an  an airport at all . ", "m :  well  surely you must have to admit that the existing airport nearby are becoming swarmed .  i mean  why should people  uhh .  .  . ", "w :  well  they aren ' t being swarmed . ", "m :  be treated like cattle when there is a chance of .  .  .  a new airport here . ", "w :  but  but really people shouldn ' t be traveling that much  that ' s  that ' s why most of the journeys  i mean  they swamped because there is far too much unnecessary tourism and so on .  it isn ' t necessary for people to travel so far or even so often . ", "m :  well  you take the climate here in this country .  now just before christmas  there was this dreadful cold spell  there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent christmas and the new year in a reasonable climate of sun and  and a certain mild climate .  and  and in summer  the same situation occurs .  it is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool . ", "w :  well  yes  i can sympathize with that .  but it is still not really necessary to do  well  as it isn ' t necessary to  to conserve fuel and it is necessary to  well  not to waste land .  i mean land for a new airport could be used for far more important things which would benefit the people here far more .  i mean it could be used for farming for instance . ", "m :  true . ", "w :  it could also be used for housing  or it could be used for parks  you know .  people then could come and enjoy themselves without having to travel far . ", "m :  but  airports do bring some local advantages .  they bring roads  there is obviously extra employment  for instance  new hotels  shops  restaurants will have to be built .  this means more jobs for the locals and it is good for local economy . ", "w :  but you ask the people  you ask those who are now living near the airports  for instance  whether whether they recon that airpotrs bring them advantages  although  all the airports bring in are noise and vast motorways  and the whole area is  is desolated  isn ' t it ? ", "m :  but the airport infra   .  .  .   infrastructure relies on housing and other facilities for the great number of people who would be employed in the airport  the pilots even  the stewardess  they have to live somewhere near the airport  right ? ", "w :  yeah  but it ' s  it ' s just so  so damaging to the whole area .  i think  airports  from my point of view  the whole concept is outdated  really .  umm  with modern technology  we can make a lot of travel unnecessary  really .  for example  it won ' t be necessary for businessmen to fly out to a foreign county to talk to somebody .  they can just leave it to the telephone in the office  press the button  and say to the person they want to do business with .  you see  business deals can be made without having to travel back and forth  right ? ", "m :  yes  you are right .  but for a lot of people  personal contact is important .  and this means travel  and means quick travel  air travel .  and we just need a new airport .
