", "kids :  we had to use the fire extinguisher . ", "chef randall :  but that ' s another story .  so  anyway  today i ' d like to share with you our favorite  .  .  .  at least my favorite  .  .  .  chocolate chip cookie recipe .  now  before you switch the tv channel  i know what you are thinking .   \" another fattening cookie recipe .  \"  but wait .  what makes this recipe great is that it offers a wonderful low - fat  low - calorie  low - cholesterol dessert for the entire family . ", "kids :  we still like the fat though . ", "chef randall :  well  i know we do .  but let ' s see .  we have all the ingredients  so we can start by mixing all of the ingredients  the sugars  the flour  the egg whites  the low - fat butter  vanilla  baking soda  and a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl .  then  we add the mini chocolate chips .  now  my kids would like me to add the big ones but we start with the mini - chocolate chips .  and don ' t forget to preheat the oven to 3 5 0 degrees  ( fahrenheit )  .  and finally  when the cookies are done  take them out of the oven  remove them from the cookie sheet  and let them cool before their fingers get into them .  did i forget anything ? ", "kids :  yeah  if you have college - age kids  be sure to make a few extra batches they can take back to school for their roommates .  and don ' t forget the kids still at home . ", "chef randall :  oh  well yeah .  we can ' t do that .  we can ' t forget them .  and unfortunately  by the time your kids get the cookies  you  the cook  will be left with a single cookie  -  your instant diet plan for you  -  and a dirty kitchen .  so  that ' s all for today .  on next week ' s show  we will be showing you how to feed hungry teenagers on a budget without having to sell the family car .  until then .
