[["m :  we are having a debate on advertising thursday evening  and i have to take part . ", "w :  that ' s interesting .  i should like to hear what people think about advertising . ", "m :  what ' s there to say ?  we must have advertising  mustn ' t we ? ", "w :  why ? ", "m :  well  we wouldn ' t know what there was to buy if we didn ' t have advertisements . ", "w :  yes  that ' s true .  up to a point  advertisements provide information that we need .  if someone has produced a new article  naturally  the seller wants to tell us about it . ", "m :  yes  and the advertisements tell us which product is the best . ", "w :  do they ?  i don ' t think so .  every manufacture says that his product is the best  or at least tries to give the impression .  only one can be the best  so the others are misleading  aren ' t they ? ", "m :  well  in a way  i suppose  but we don ' t have to believe them  do we ? ", "w :  are you saying that advertisements aren ' t effective ?  i don ' t think that intelligent businessmen will spend millions of dollars on advertising if nobody believes the advertisements  do you ? ", "m :  perhaps not  but after all  it ' s their money that they are spending . ", "w :  is it ?  i think not .  the cost of advertising is added to the price of the article .  you and i and all the other people who buy the article pay for the advertising . ", "m :  well  i suppose we get something for our money  some information . ", "w :  yes  but don ' t forget it is often misleading information  and sometimes harmful . ", "m :  harmful ? ", "w :  what about the advertisements desiring to persuade young people to smoke cigarettes ?  wouldn ' t you say the are harmful ? ", "m :  you ' ve given me a lot to think about .  i ' m quite looking forward to the debate now . "], [{"question": "according to the woman  advertisements _ .
