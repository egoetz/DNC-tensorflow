[["w :  come to my office  billy .  look at your messy hair .  this is the third time you have been late for class within this week .  and every time you went in  you disturbed the teacher ' s class . ", "m :  sorry  miss .  i didn ' t mean to do that  but it was my alarm clock that didn ' t wake me up . ", "w :  that is not a proper excuse .  you could set it ahead of the exact time so that you could have got up earlier and not have been late . ", "m :  i did that  but it seemed useless when i found the batteries had run out after i woke up this morning .  i rushed to school and luckily  my neighbour mr .  green gave me a hand and took me to school with his car . ", "w :  so you could have made it .  but you were still late for class . ", "m :  the thing is  when i got off  i found i had left my bag in his car .  and it was too late to get it back when i realized that .  i went straight to the nearest shop and gave him a call .  i waited for five minutes before mr .  green drove back . ", "w :  finally  he gave you your bag and you came to the classroom and you were already 15 minutes late for class at that time .  is that all ? ", "m :  miss  you seem to know the entire story .  may i go back to class now ?  otherwise i will be late for the following class . "], [{"question": "why was the boy asked to go to the office ?
