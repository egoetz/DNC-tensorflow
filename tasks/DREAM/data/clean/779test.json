[["m :  could you suggest some ways to bring family members closer together ? ", "w :  well  i feel it is very important for families to have regular meals together .  one of my good childhood memories was dinner with my parents and two sisters .  because my husband and i both worked and our three children were busy with their studies  we seldom had a chance to get together as a family .  but we thought it would be possible for us to sit down and enjoy meals together every week .  first we tried setting fixed days :  mondays  wednesdays  and fridays .  but almost everyone was unhappy .  then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and i would choose the two best days .  for a while the children were still unhappy with the idea .  they said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports .  gradually  though  they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful .  we loved a lot .  we made plans for trips .  we discussed each other ' s problems .  after a couple of months anyone who had to miss a family meal felt regretful .  and now we all feel than we have been able to build stronger relationships within the family that we had before .
