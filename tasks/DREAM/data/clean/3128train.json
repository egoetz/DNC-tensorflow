[["w :  i don ' t understand how the inventor earns money from the invention .  after all  anyone can copy and sell it .  really  what is a patent ?  a piece of paper ?  a philosophy ?  you can ' t see it . ", "m :  i am glad you asked that .  actually when an inventor has a patent  it ' s enforceable by the laws in the country where the inventor developed the invention .  if anyone makes and sells the product then the inventor can take them to civil court . ", "w :  what can the inventor expect to receive if he sues and wins ? ", "m :  well  there are different things the court could do  but there ' s no guarantee .  there ' s a good chance the court could award him compensation and orders to stop the manufacture and sale of goods .  it may well be that the goods would be ordered to be destroyed . ", "w :  can the other person being sued do anything to help themselves ? ", "m :  that ' s the beauty of the whole thing .  ignorance of the law doesn ' t count  i ' m afraid .  however  the other person can counter - sue pretending that they were actually the original inventor . ", "w :  you said the inventor is protected by the laws of the country .  is everything equal ?  do all countries have the same law ? ", "m :  no  they ' re not all equal .  you ' re right .  it ' s only in theory .  it is being worked on .  the world trade organization has developed an agreement  trade - related aspects of intellectual property rights  which makes sure that the patent is valid for 20 years . ", "w :  that doesn ' t make sense .  twenty years is a long time . ", "m :  actually  it does .  it ' s believed that inventors make and sell goods faster after they register the patent because there ' s a 20 - year limitation on the patent .  on the other hand  other inventors can use the information the inventor disclosed when the product was registered .  giving the information is all part of the deal .
