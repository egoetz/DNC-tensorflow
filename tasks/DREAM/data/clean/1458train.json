[["m :  our guest today is alas baker who has a very unusual ability .  alas  thank you for coming into the studio .  what kind of unusual ability are we talking about here ? ", "w :  wow  it ' s quite easy to describe .  basically  when i read a word or even think of a particular word  such as tuesday  i see a color connected with it .  it ' s not that i imagine a color .  i really see it loading in front of my eyes . ", "m :  how interesting !  is it a sort of medical condition ? ", "w :  yes .  and just recently doctors have begun to understand it more .  they call it synesthesia  which means that somewhere in my brain  there are links between sections that should really be separate .  other people have a form of this condition that affects emotions .  so they see colors when they feel particular emotions .  apparently  it ' s generally passed on from parents to their children  which is the case with me . ", "m :  do you have any brothers or sisters with the same ability ? ", "w :  yes  my brother is the same as me .  if we start talking about it  people think we are completely mad .  when we were younger  we used to have arguments about things like what color the word tuesday is .  it turns out that everyone with this condition sees different colors . ", "m :  it sounds as though it could make life quite exhausting . ", "w :  i suppose it does .  but you see  if you ' ve never known anything different  you don ' t think of it like that .  it does make you aware of your moods .  i know when i started to feel depressed  things begin to look grey . ", "m :  are there any other advantages do you find ? ", "w :  well  it seems that quite a lot of artists and musicians have this condition .  so i guess it can be beneficial if it ' s combined with some sort of gift or natural talent  which is not the case with me unfortunately .  but i do find that it makes reading very interesting  because sometimes a sentence has a very nice range of colors .  so you want to read it again just to experience that .  of course  this makes me quite a slow reader .
