[["lisa :  hi  tim .  so  are you doing some last - minute shopping before the weekend ? ", "tim :  well  actually  i ' m looking for supplies to put together 7 2 - hour kits for each member of my family . ", "lisa :   [ a ]  7 2 - hour kit ?  what ' s that ? ", "tim :  basically  a 7 2 - hour kit contains emergency supplies you would need to sustain yourself for three days in case of an emergency  like an earthquake . ", "lisa :  an earthquake ?  !  we haven ' t had an earthquake in years . ", "tim :  well  you never know ;  you have to be prepared .  hey  if earthquakes don ' t get you  it could be a flood  hurricane  snowstorm  power outage  fire  alien attack .   [ alien attack !  ]  well  you never know .  think of any situation in which you might find yourself without the basic necessities of life  including shelter  food  and water  for over a period of time . ", "lisa :  hum .  so  what do you keep in a 4 2 - hour  um   .  .  .  i mean 7 2 - kit ? ", "tim :  well  you should have enough food and water to last you three days  and you might want to pack a basic water filter or water purification tablets in case your only water source turns out to be a murky pool of bug - infested water .   [ ugh !  ]  hey  sometimes you don ' t have a choice  and as for food  you should keep it simple :  food that requires no preparation and that doesn ' t spoil .  and no canned goods because they are often too heavy and bulky .   [ okay  that makes sense .  ]  and unless you have a can opener or the can has a pull - tab lid  you ' ll have to use a rock or something to open them .   [ ah  instant mashed green beens .  ]  yeah  and oh  energy bars  beef jerky  and a mix of nuts  raisins  and chocolate are possibilities . ", "lisa :  huh  the food might be nasty  but i guess you could survive  .  .  .  barely . ", "tim :  well  the food doesn ' t have to taste bad ;  just select things that are easy to prepare  and you might want to include some basic comfort foods like a couple of candy bars .  then  you have to decide on the type of shelter you might need . ", "lisa :  a hotel sounds nice . ", "tim :  yeah  but that ' s really not an option .  the reality is that you might have to evacuate to a shelter  possibly with hundreds or thousands of other people . ", "lisa :  that doesn ' t sound very fun  .  .  .  everyone packed together like sardines in a can .  unsanitary conditions .  disease . ", "tim :  ah  now you ' re sounding paranoid  but if a shelter isn ' t available  you might be completely on your own  so i always pack an emergency sleeping bag or small  lightweight tent in the event that i have to survive on the street or in a park . ", "lisa :  wow . ", "tim :  and among other things  you should pack a flashlight  portable radio  extra batteries  a small first - aid kit  personal items like a toothbrush or toothpaste  .  .  .  having a change of clothing is also important . ", "lisa :  what about money ?  i have a credit card . ", "tim :  right .  like that ' s going to help when the power is out .  you ' d better be prepared with coins and cash  and having small bills is a must . ", "lisa :  so  what do you do to communicate with other family members in case you get separated ? ", "tim :  oh  in that case ?  i always pack two - way radios to communicate with the group .  you can never depend on cell phones .   [ okay .  ]  plus  you should decide on a meeting point in case your family gets separated . ", "lisa :  well  that sounds like a detailed plan  definitely . ", "tim :  oh  that ' s not all .  you never know what weather conditions you might encounter  so packing a rain poncho  a jacket  and something to start a fire with could be very useful . ", "lisa :  like matches ? ", "tim :  matches ?   ( if )  you drop those in a puddle of water  you ' re toast .  you need to pack at least three forms of fire starter :  a magnifying glass  a high - quality lighter  and waterproof matches . ", "lisa :  wow .  i never thought about those either .  so  what do you do if you have small kids ?  they ' d probably go stir - crazy under such conditions . ", "tim :  you ' re exactly right  so a little extra preparation for them is needed .  if you have to evacuate to a shelter to wait out a disaster  kids soon will be bored out of their minds  so you have to pack small card games  paper  or something like pencils or crayons to draw with . ", "lisa :  you know  preparing a 7 2 - hour kit makes perfect sense  .  .  . ", "tim :  yeah  but most people thinking about it after it is too late .
