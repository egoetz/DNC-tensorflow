[["w :  we all know that poetry is not everyone ' s cup of tea .  but according to dr james stewart . ", "m :  hello ! ", "w :  hello !  if you are suffering from anxiety or depression  poetry may be the solution to your problems .  dr stewart  how does poetry help ? ", "m :  em  ok !  look  let me give you an example .  a patient came into our clinic last month .  he was a middle - aged businessmen  and he was feeling  well  like most middle - aged businessmen  really stressed and with his life out of control .  he talked to me about it  and  well  i was convinced that medication just wouldn ' t help him .  then i read him a poem called leisure by whdavis .  do you know the one ?  it begins  er .  .  . ", "w :  i do  yes . ", "m :  what is this life  er  so full of .  it is so or if .  .  . ", "w :  i think it ' s if . ", "m :  if full of care  that ' s it  yes .  we have no time to stand and stare .  well  you know the one .  the next time he came to see me  he told me that  well  it was a sort of turning point for him .  the poem made him think about the quality of his life and the need to find a balance between his work and his social life .  er  you see  because the idea was expressed poetically  he felt that he could identify with it  and actually feel the message in a way that he wouldn ' t if he simply discussed it with me .  and we just had the usual kind of conversation about it . ", "w :  yes  i see . ", "m :  you see  reading poetry to patients seems to make them calmer .  encouraging them to write it has an even more dramatic effect  actually .  era  there .  .   there are something about the process of expressing confused thoughts and feelings and emotions in writing that actually helps people or suffering from stress and anxiety .  this happens especially if the words are written in a poetical way with a sense of rhythm rather than in prose  you see .  er  now  for a long time  we ' ve been asking patients to write diaries to put their feelings into words .  but it turns out that writing poetry seems to work much better for many patients . ", "w :  right  and have you found that other doctors and therapists have made the same discoveries ? ", "m :  yes  many of my colleagues have successfully used poetry with patients suffering from anxiety or depression or even eating disorders .  i mean their patients said that  that reading poetry made them feel less stressed .  you know  almost as many said that writing it has the same effect .  you see  some said that writing poetry reduced the pain they felt when a friend or a close relation had died extraordinarily ! ", "w :  yes  it certainly is ! ", "m :  era .  others thought that it enabled them to reduce or stop taking antidepressants or tranquillizers .  and writing poetry helps them to provide a sort of outlet for their emotions . ", "w :  em  that ' s fascinating !  can you give any explanation as to why poetry might be calming in this way ? ", "m :  well  it ' s only a guess .  but i say that the calming effect of poetry is related to an interplay between the left and right hemispheres of the brain  the .  .   you probably know the left half is the one which analyzes and responds to language while the right one visualizes images and responds to rhythm .  now  i believe that poetry may activate the system at the base of the brain where thoughts meet emotions  you see . ", "w :  do you think that people need a doctor to prescribe particular poems for particular conditions ? ", "m :  no  no  no .  i think poetry can help everyone to feel calm and less stressed .  people who read poetry tend not to be anxious and stressed  probably because they are in touch with their emotions .  i mean they certainly don ' t need a doctor to tell them which poems to read . ", "w :  thank you very much  dr stewart . ", "m :  you are welcome . "], [{"question": "who did dr stewart read a poem to ? ", "choice": ["an actor . ", "a business person . ", "mr davies .
