[["w :  well  mr smith  we have had an interesting discussion about your work .  now  tell us something about your after - work activities . ", "m :  i guess not much different from everyone else .  i ' m interested in sport  and i run about 3 miles every day .  i particularly enjoy cross - country running  where you have to run across fields  jump over streams and so on .  while i ' m running i think about all sorts of things  and at the end of a run i ' m sometimes surprised to find that i ' ve managed to solve a problem that was on my mind .  next year i ' m going to try the london marathon .  it ' s a long  hard race  -  26 miles  or 42 kilometres  -  and you have to be tough to finish  but i very much want to do it .  i worry a bit about getting old and i ' d like to prove to myself that i ' m still almost as fit as i was twenty years ago .  i ' m interested in climbing as well as running .  i ' ll never become an expert climber  but i know what i ' m doing in the mountains .  i successfully completed a course in snow and ice climbing when i was younger  and i ' ve done a series of easy climbs in the alps during the last few years .  my wife doesn ' t share my interest in mountains .  she agreed to go climbing with me once  but she found that she felt ill as soon as she got above 1000 metres  so we decide to follow different hobbies . ", "w :  you certainly seem to enjoy various types of recreation .  all right  mr smith .  thanks for your interesting talk . "], [{"question": "what are the man ' s hobbies ?
