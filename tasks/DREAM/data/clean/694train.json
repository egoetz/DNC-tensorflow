", "w :  why not ?  is the professor awful or is the lecturing boring ? ", "m :  the professor is nice enough .  but the course is nothing but physics and chemistry with lots of equations .  you can ' t just mix the right chemicals and watch what happens .  as you go along you have to keep care notes and turn it all into a bunch of numbers and formulas after the experiment is over .  it was the worst course i ' ve ever taken . ", "w :  what you say is no problem for me .  to tell you the truth   [  like formulas and numbers .  that ' s what i ' m different from you . ", "m :  is it ?  then you ' ll love it if it is the case .  but all that i was interested in was biology and we didn ' t get to that till the last three weeks of the class .  what a year !
