[["interviewer :  what were the things in britain that you found most strange when you first arrived ? ", "mathew :  well  the first thing is driving on the wrong side of the road .  .  .   that would be the -  that was very strange because you have this automatic reflex when you go out into the street to look one way and a couple of times i did that and i almost got hit by cars and bikes and all  you know .  it ' s dangerous .  it really is dangerous .  and you have to teach yourself to look the other way . ", "interviewer :  someone said that britain and the united states are divided by a common language .  have you had any difficulties with the language here ? ", "mathew :  oh  yeah - tremendous amount of difficulty but i ' m starting to pick it up now - all the lingo and slang and all those - but there ' s definitely a difference . ", "interviewer :  can you give me any example ? ", "mathew :  well  the big - i ' d say some of the biggest ones would be the word  \" queue \"  which means in america  \" line \"  .  i never heard the word  \" queue \"  before .  um - what you call  \" chips \"   i call  \" french fries \"  .  i never heard them called  \" chips \"  .  urn - there ' s so many - urn - words that are different .  ah -  \"  crisps \"  which mean  \"  potato chips \"  yeah  that ' s  -  we call them  \" potato chips \"  or  \" chips \"  in america .  you call them  \" crisps \"  here .  so when i heard the word  \" chips \"   i was thinking of  \" crisps \"  and not french fry - you know - it ' s very confusing but - urn - but just some of the expressions like - er -  \"  mate \"  you know and  \" love \"  .  those - you know -  - they ' re funny .  you don ' t hear them .  you don ' t hear them in america . ", "interviewer :  what about with young people - with people your own age - i mean  do you notice differences there ? ", "mathew :  i do notice some differences - er - i think - ah - i think the younger people in britain are - they seem to be - much more radical than the younger people in the united states .  i noticed that .  ah - the dress is different .  you see a lot of - i see a lot of males here with earring in one of their - in one of their ears .  you don ' t see that in america that much .  somet - maybe here and there  but not  not like you see it here .  ah - so many of the young people wear black - clothing - you know  i don ' t - you don ' t see the other colors .  at home you see all different types of bright colors - and in england you see so much black .  especially on the women . ", "interviewer :  you don ' t like that ? ", "mathew :  not really .  it ' s just my own preference .  i like - i ' d rather see different colors here and there - not all - not all one color .  everyone looks like madonna . ", "interviewer :  when you say  \" radical \"  - do you - are you just thinking of clothes or of anything else ? ", "mathew :  um - no  i think - er - radical as in going against the norms - could you say ?  not only in clothing but i think in politics too whereas in america - er - you don ' t find that as much .  oh  also  another difference is the young - er - the younger people are - they ' re more politically aware on a larger level .  see a lot of the - a lot of the americans -  they ' re aware of - er - government of the united states and maybe a few other countries but not as many countries in europe or they just have a vague understanding of how those other countries are run - not as widespread .  whereas here  i think that they -  er - the kids get to know about how different countries are run at a much younger level and they know all about the united states and how it ' s run . ", "interviewer :  what do you think the reasons are for that ? ", "mathew :  urn - that ' s a good question - urn - well  i think that the reasons are - just because of the press .  you hear so much about america here that people are - they ' re into it - they want to know what it ' s about and how it ' s run .  and so many of our policies in america affect britain that they want to understand how policies are made and all that and seeing that that doesn ' t work on the other level like britain ' s policies don ' t - i mean  they can affect us  but not to as great an extent and therefore you don ' t hear as much about britain and people don ' t know as much about it .
