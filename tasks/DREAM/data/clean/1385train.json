[["m :  i got two letters this morning with job offers  one from the polytechnic  and the other from the language school in pistoia  italy . ", "w :  so you are not sure which to go for ? ", "m :  that ' s it .  of course  the conditions of work are very different :  the polytechnic is offering two - year contract which could be renewed  but the language school is only offering a year ' s contract  and that ' s a definite minus .  it could be renewed  but you never know . ", "w :  i see .  so it ' s much less secure .  but you don ' t need to think too much about steady jobs when you are only 23 . ", "m :  that ' s true . ", "w :  what about the salaries ? ", "m :  well  the pistoia job pays much better in the short term .  i ' ll be getting the equivalent of about 22 000 pounds a year there  but only 20 000 pounds at the polytechnic .  but then the hours are different .  at the polytechnic i ' d have to do 35 hours a week  20 teaching and 15 administration  whereas the pistoia school is only asking for 30 hours teaching . ", "w :  mmm .  .  . ", "m :  then the type of teaching is so different .  the polytechnic is all adults and mostly preparation for exams like the cambridge certificates .  the language school wants me to do a bit of exam preparation  but also quite a lot of work in companies and factories  and a couple of children ' s classes .  oh  and a bit of literature teaching . ", "w :  well  that sounds much more varied and interesting .  and i ' d imagine you ' d be doing quite a lot of teaching outside the school  and moving around quite a bit . ", "m :  yes  whereas with the polytechnic position  i ' d be stuck in the school all day . "], [{"question": "what do we learn about the man from the conversation ?
