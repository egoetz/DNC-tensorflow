", "b :  35 . ", "a :  right  great .  and your job ? ", "b :  systems analyst  but for the form i don ' t know whether it would count as professional or business or what . ", "a :  what do you think ? ", "b :  ok  it ' s more like business . ", "a :  fine .  and would you mind my asking about your salary ?  or we can leave it blank . ", "b :  no  i don ' t mind .  it ' s 40 000 a year . ", "a :  thank you .  right .  .  .  about your current watching habits .  .  .   what would you say is your main reason for watching tv ?

", "b :  i think i ' d advise them to pay a lot of attention to the quality of the actual broadcast  you know  the sound system .  people are very fussy these days about that and in general i think they ought to do lots more of these kinds of interview  you know  talking with their potential customers . ", "a :  oh  i ' m glad you think it ' s valuable ! ", "b :  certainly .  .  .  yeah . ", "a :  good .  ok  this will be a commercial channel of course  but how often do you think it is tolerable to have adverts ?
