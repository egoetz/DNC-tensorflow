[["w :  what are the main differences between this country and your country ? ", "m :  well  in russia  everything happens very fast .  people talk quickly  they drive their cars too fast  the good deals go by really quickly .  .  . but here in canada  it seems like people are a little more relaxed . ", "w :  is that true for everything ? ", "m :  no  of course not .  in russia  going to the bank can take hours .  the same is true for the post office and the supermarket .  in canada  however  these places are pretty easy to get through quickly . ", "w :  so  what is it that makes some things go either faster or slower compared to us here in canada ?  i was born and raised here  so i guess i don ' t notice these things .  i ' ve also never been outside the country before . ", "m :  i think the people in russia are fast movers by nature  at least in the big cities .  public places are still very slow because they haven ' t tried to do business any differently than they used to . ", "w :  but in canada  it ' s the opposite ? ", "m :  right .  the government here does a great job of solving problems and using new technology to make businesses work better .  but i think canadians are just more calm in general than russians are .  .  .  and they ' re definitely more relaxed than americans !
