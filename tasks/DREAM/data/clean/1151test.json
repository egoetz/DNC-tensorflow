[["w :  dr thomas ?  this is keet bradley from daily news .  i ' d like to ask you some questions about the new official standard weight that you purchased . ", "m :  i ' d be happy to help you .  what would you like to know ? ", "w :  first of all  how was the standard weight used ? ", "m :  well  the people in our department use it to check the scales all over the country .  the department of weights and measures  we are a government agency .  it ' s our responsibility to see that all the scales measure a kilogram accurately so this is the way we use to adjust the scales . ", "w :  how did you check the scales before ? ", "m :  we have an old standard weight that we used to use .  it had to be replaced because it was imprecise .  you see it was made of poor quality metal that was too porous .  it absorbed too much moisture . ", "w :  oh .  so when the weather was humid it weighed more and when it was dry it weighed less . ", "m :  exactly .  and that variation can affect the standards of the whole country .  so our department had the new weight made out of higher quality metal . ", "w :  how much did it cost ? ", "m :  about 4 5 thousand dollars . ", "w :  4 5 0 0 0 dollars ?  for one kilogram weight ?  that ' s more expensive than gold .  is it really worth that much ? ", "m :  i ' m sure it is .  industries depend on our government agency to monitor the accuracy of scales so that when they buy and sell their products there is one standard .  think of the drug industry  for example  those companies rely on high accuracy scales to manufacture and package medicine .
