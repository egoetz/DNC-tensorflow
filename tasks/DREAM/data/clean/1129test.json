[["f :  well  i ' m sure all our listeners would love to be brought up to date on the latest in tiny televisions . ", "m :  it ' s an expanding market  that ' s for sure  and they seem to be getting smaller every year . ", "f :  which countries are dominating the market ? ", "m :  at the moment it ' s japan  principally .  in the spring of 1 9 8 2 sony introduced the watchman ? ", "f :  is that the walkman ? ", "m :  no  the watchman is a portable black and white tv set with a tiny screen and aerial . ", "f :  how big is the whole thing ? ", "m :  oh  i ' d say about 3 5 cm by 1 2 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms . ", "f :  was it a success from the start ? ", "m :  funnily enough  a sony executive said that no one would want to watch a tv while walking around - and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price ! ", "f :  really ? ", "m :  but  despite this pessimistic view  sales of this model far outnumbered projections . ", "f :  well  you never can tell !  how big was the initial production ? ", "m :  the company started with 2 0 0 0 units per month and increased to 5 0 0 0 by the end of 1 9 8 2  but they still couldn ' t keep up with the demand . ", "f :  so i suppose they upped the production levels even higher . ", "m :  it was much more radical than that !  in the spring of 1 9 8 3 sony pulled out all the stops and launched the watchman all over again with a new model . ", "f :  oh  what ' s it like ? ", "m :  well  it ' s 2 0 per cent smaller and the price is 2 5 percent less .  .  . ", "f :  mmmm . ", "m :  and the components were designed from scratch . ", "f :  and what about production levels ? ", "m :  they quadrupled to 2 0 0 0 0 units a month just for the japanese market ! ", "f :  wow !  the watchman certainly seems to have taken off . ", "m :  indeed it has . ", "f :  and i believe there were other japanese companies as well . ", "m :  yes .  at the end of 1 9 8 2 hattori - that ' s h - a - t - t - o - r - i -  - you know  the makers of seiko watches - well  they unveiled an even smaller tv  around 3 era  which is built into a wrist - watch . ", "f :  incredible ! ", "m :  it certainly is .  the rest of the set is carried separately in your pocket and it ' s about the size of a packet of kingsize cigarettes . ", "f :  and how does it work ? ", "m :  it has a liquid crystal display screen .  the tv receiver and battery pack fit into your pocket  and they ' re connected by a cord to the watch . ", "f :  is there a headphone ? ", "m :  oh  yes  that ' s plugged into the receiver as well . ", "f :  seems a bit complicated  that one  with all the wires and bits and pieces . ", "m :  yes  it does . ", "f :  any other japanese models ? ", "m :  yes  casio - that ' s c - a - s - i - o .  their latest is a calculator - sized tv about one - third the bulk of the watchman and with 1 9 8 3 production figures of 2 0 0 0 units a month . ", "f :  i see . ", "m :  and  according to a spokesman  they hope to match their calculator sales  which are about 2 5 million units per year . ", "f :  very impressive .  and no doubt other japanese companies will jump on the bandwagon . ", "m :  most likely . ", "f :  now  could you tell us about other countries making these tiny tvs ? ", "m :  of course .  from sinclair in england there ' s one similar in size to the casio  and their production levels were 1 million for 1 9 8 3 . ", "f :  obviously they ' re planning on backing a winner ! ", "m :  how right you are .  a representative said they expect a mass - market response  not just a novelty item . ", "f :  and just which market are the manufactures aiming at ? ", "m :  mainly the commuters who spend hours going to and from work .  these tvs will provide relief from the monotonous train and bus rides . ", "f :  well  thank you for keeping us in touch with this extremely popular gadget . ", "m :  my pleasure  and happy viewing to all of you with those tvs .
