[["m :  we are glad to have dr .  garfield to talk to us today about dreams .  let me start by asking the first question .  does everyone dream ? ", "w :  it appears that everyone does .  mostly when people say that they never dream  what they really mean is that they don ' t remember their dreams or they don ' t think their dreams are important .  the reason behind is that they might have been made fun of with a child when they first reported their dreams or it was so frightening that they just turned off dreaming completely .  the other day  someone named davis came to me and said that he used to be a great dreamer  but suddenly he stopped having dreams .  i asked him what it happened .  it turned out that his brother died by heart attack and he never expected that such a terrible thing would happen to a young person .  generally  when there was some frightening event and dream about it was too terrible .  people prefer not to dream about it .  actually the worst thing you can do is stop dreaming .  because it means that the bad experience would be too painful to even appear in dreams .  as long as you dream about it and even the dream is frightening  your mind is working on it .  my personal opinion about what dreams do is that they help us deal with our problems .  we see certain patterns take place in dreams .  when a person is hurt deep inside  when a person is seriously ill or when a person has been really sad  if people turn off their dreams totally  it means they don ' t love themselves to even think about it .
