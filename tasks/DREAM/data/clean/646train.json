", "w :  well  can we summarize the problem from my point of view ?  first of all  the campaign was late .  it missed two important trade affairs .  the ads also did not appear into key magazines .  as a result  the campaign failed .  do you accept that summary of what happened ? ", "m :  well  the delay wasn ' t entirely our fault .  you did in fact make late changes to the specifications of the advertisements .

", "w :  that ' s not really the point .  the campaign missed two key trade affairs .  because of this  we are asking you either to repeat the campaign next year for free  or we only pay 5 0 %  of the fee for this year .
