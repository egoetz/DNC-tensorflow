[["w :  what does the term  \" alternative energy source \"  mean ? ", "m :  when we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars  we think of petroleum  a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground  of which there is a limited supply .  but alternative fuels can be many things .  wind  sun and water can all be used to create fuel . ", "w :  is the threat of running out of petroleum real ? ", "m :  it has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time .  the real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use .  most experts agree that by around 2 0 2 5  the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak .  then production and availability will begin to seriously decline .  this is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point .  but it ' ll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract . ", "w :  is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources ? ", "m :  there are two very clear reasons to do so .  one is that whether we have 6 0 or 6 00 years of fossil fuels left  we have to find other fuel sources eventually .  so the sooner we start  the better off we will be .  the other big argument is that when long time  which leads to some long - term negative effects  like global warming and the greenhouse effect .
