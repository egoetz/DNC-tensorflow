[["w :  dr smith  you were a political journalist in america and i was told that you ' ve chosen to live here  a mountain village like this in the himalayan community .  could you please tell me why you came to india and settled down here ? ", "m :  yes  of course .  i came to india a year ago to have a better understanding of the country .  after i arrived  i had to find a place where i could live and write .  of course there were many places for me to choose .  but after some months i settled down happily in this village because i like the countryside better and it is a little cooler than those in the plains . ", "w :  have you ever thought of a typical village as a better choice ? ", "m :  yes  i have .  yet no such thing exists .  in fact i wasted a lot of time looking for the typical village .  conditions vary too widely .  but the villages i stayed in had much in common -  poverty  dirt  and ignorance . ", "w :  but in spite of all this  you still feel very happy .  is the experience in this country so important to you that you came all the way from the united states ? ", "m :  well  that ' s also the question that the villagers ask me .  they think that i ' m crazy to give up my comfortable life in the united states and isolate myself from the outside world in this remote village  like a retired old man why have i come ?  i ' ve put aside my work as a political journalist because my ideas have changed .  i ' ve come to believe that what is happening in the third world is more important than anything else .  but to understand how three - quarters of the world ' s people live  and how their future might affect the rest of the world  i feel that i first have to try and share their way of life . ", "w :  i must say i find your view on this issue very convincing .  i ' m sure when you go back to your own country you ' ll find your stay here very rewarding .
