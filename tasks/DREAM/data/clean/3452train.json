[["m :  you know the weather ' s been awful so far this summer .

", "m :  well  either way i love it .  i remember last summer .  oh  it was terrible .  i didn ' t have an air - conditioner  and my apartment was on the fifth floor .  every night i slept on top of my bed with the windows wide - open and a fan six inches from my face . ", "w :  that sounds pretty tough .  i guess i ' ve gotten used to the heat  so i don ' t notice it as much .  however  last year was definitely a lot hotter than this year .  and  to be honest  i am enjoying the break .  what are summers like for you back home ? ", "m :  for one thing  there ' s little humidity .  seattle is right on the ocean so we always have a nice offshore breeze blowing in  and it doesn ' t really get hot until late july .  that ' s why i found it so oppressive last year .  our summers are just so different .
