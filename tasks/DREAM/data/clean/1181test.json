", "w :  but it happens all the time .  if the professor asks a question and i know the answer  i blush like crazy if he calls on me .  doesn ' t that ever happen to you ?

", "m :  i don ' t know  but i had a friend at high schools  brian smith .  it was really easy to make him blush .  he turned red whenever a waitress would ask him for his order .
