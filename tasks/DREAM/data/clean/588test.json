[["m :  hi  lynn .  i saw you at registration yesterday .  i sailed right through  but you were standing in a long line . ", "w :  yeah .  i waited an hour to sign up for a distance - learning course . ", "m :  distance learning ?  never heard of it . ", "w :  well  it ' s new this semester .  it ' s only open to psychology majors .  but i bet it ' ll catch on elsewhere .  yesterday  over a hundred students signed up . ", "m :  well  what is it ? ", "w :  it ' s an experimental course .  i registered for child psychology .  all i have got to do is watch a twelve - week series of televised lessons .  the department shows them several different times a day and in several different locations . ", "m :  don ' t you ever have to meet with professor ? ", "w :  yeah .  after each part of the series i have to talk to her and the other students on the phone  you know  about our ideas .  then we ' ll meet on campus three times for reviews and exams . ", "m :  it sounds pretty non - traditional to me .  but i guess it makes sense  considering how many students have jobs .  it must really help with their schedules  not to mention how it will cut down on traffic . ", "w :  you know last year my department did a survey and they found out that 8 0 percent of all psychology majors were employed .  that ' s why they came up with the program . ", "m :  the only thing is :  doesn ' t it seem impersonal though ?  i mean  i miss having class discussions and hearing what other people thinks . ", "w :  well  i guess that ' s why phone contact ' s important .  any way  it ' s an experiment .  maybe i ' ll end up hating it . ", "m :  maybe .  but i ' ll be curious to see how it works up .
