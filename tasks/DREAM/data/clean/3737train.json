[["m :  mary  you know i ' ve been thinking about applying for a job in germany .  well  i ' ve got the details about different jobs and i ' d like your opinion about which would be the best one to go for . ", "f :  where are the jobs ? ", "m :  one ' s in munich  one ' s in frankfurt and the other one ' s in hamburg . ", "f :  munich ' s supposed to be a very nice place . ", "m :  yes it is  and it ' s also in a beautiful part of germany  not far from the alias . ", "f :  that would be great for the kids -  - they ' d love to be able to go skiing at weekends ! ", "m :  but  one problem with munich is that it ' s growing very fast .  that means the cost of living will probably be very high . ", "f :  it ' s a higher salary than the job in frankfurt but lower than the one in hamburg .  the hamburg job has the most responsibility .  from the point of view of career progression that would probably be the best job for me . ", "f :  hamburg ' s the closest to britain  too  so it would be easy to come back for long weekends and holidays . ", "m :  that ' s right  and there ' s a regular ferry service which would save quite a bit on fares . ", "f :  what about the cost of living in germany as a whole ?  how does it compare with britain ? ", "m :  well  it ' s definitely higher than over here  but salaries are substantially higher  so we ' d certainly be better off than we are now . ", "f :  and what about accommodation ? ", "m :  well  actually  flats are much cheaper to rent in towns like munich  frankfurt and hamburg than they are here in london  so we ' d be able to afford to live in a nice  spacious flat  i ' d think . ", "f :  mmm  that ' d be nice !  and do you know what the cultural facilities are like in these cities ? ", "m :  in fact  they ' re quite good in all three .  but  of course  munich has an international reputation as a cultural center . ", "f :  another thing we ' ll have to consider  of course  are the educational possibilities .  how long would you want to go to germany for ? ", "m :  i think a maximum of five years .  i think working overseas will be good for my career and  of course  it ' d be a good experience for you and the kids  too ! ", "f :  so we ' d be there long enough to enable john to complete a university course . ", "m :  well  yes we would  unless of course he preferred to go to a university in the uk .  but  yes  if he did want to go to university in germany  there ' d be no problem as each of those cities have their own universities .  munich  in fact  has the second largest university in germany . ", "f :  well  it seems to me the choice must be between hamburg and munch .  hamburg has the advantage of being the closest to britain  so coming home would be relatively easy and inexpensive .  munich  on the other hand  sounds like the most interesting place from a cultural point of view . ", "m :  i agree with you .  personally  i favor munich because it ' s so near to the alps .  we all like sliding and we could go skiing at weekends in the winter . ", "f :  i think you ' re right .  i had thought hamburg might be preferable because it ' s the closest to britain .  but we ' ll only be abroad for five years  and if we ' re going to be away  let ' s choose the most attractive place we can . ", "m :  right .  that ' s agreed .  now all i have to do is get the job ! "], [{"question": "what is the main topic between the man and the woman ?
