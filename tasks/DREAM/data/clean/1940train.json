[["w :  good morning  everybody .  today  for our writing class  we are glad to have mr .  henry stone with us  a well - known writer in this country .  he is going to share with us his writing experiences .  now  henry  please tell us how you find so many interesting things for your stories . ", "m :  ok .  i watch people a lot .  i do that when i travel .  i ' ve been to many countries such as britain  italy and sweden .  so i spend a lot of time at airports .  while waiting for my flights  i watch people passing by and start my imagination .  for example  the other day  when i was waiting for my flight to greece  i saw a couple .  they were buying magazines at that moment .  they were not wearing business clothes  but the man was carrying a suitcase .  every few seconds  the woman looked around .  i wondered if someone was following them .  perhaps they were running away  and you know  this reminded me of a story in the newspaper that day :  a bank clerk stole one million pounds a week before and disappeared with his wife .  there was a picture of them in the paper .  the couple really looked like the wiz .  maybe i should stop them .  just then  i saw them say goodbye to each other  and the woman walked away .  well  sometimes i make mistakes like that .  but i find things like that are very useful for my writing .
