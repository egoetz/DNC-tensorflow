[["m :  i think that intermarriage is a good idea .  after all  we are living in a cosmopolitan country .  we have so many different races living together peacefully  don ' t we ?  it is nothing new to us  and i feel that inter -  marriage will work out", "w :  personally  i feel that it is not a very sound idea .  it is difficult for two people of entirely different religions to live and share life together .  they will face so many problems that it would be better if they don ' t get married in the first place . ", "m :  of course there will be problems .  even two people of the same religion have problems .  it is the same in this case .  except that it will be slightly more difficult  i guess . ", "w :  i agree with you  henry .  naturally  there will be arguments and personal differences .  marriage thrives on a give - and - take policy  so a couple will have to learn to adapt to each other ' s customs and traditions . ", "m :  that ' s right .  married people should be more tolerant towards each other and be willing to learn about each other ' s religion .  only then can understanding and acceptance be achieved ultimately . ", "w :  you talk as if it were very simple .  it isn ' t  you know .  i should know .  as i am a child of a mixed marriage . ", "m :  all right  you tell us why is is not such a good idea . ", "w :  you see  henry  it depends on the individuals concerned .  if two people of different religions marry  they should be prepared for the consequences .  it is only after marriage that the vast differences in the cultures begin to show .  little things  from food and clothes to bigger aspects like religious beliefs  tend to clash  leading eventually to a rift .  besides .  there will be either personal pride or the reluctance to accept the other ' s views .  it may lead to a big gap between the parents  and their children may suffer a lot in between . ", "m :  you have a point there .  but i can also tell you of several such couples who are living happily together . ", "w :  i suppose that you are right .  intermarriage can lead to happiness or sorrow  depending on how it is handled .
