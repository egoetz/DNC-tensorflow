[["program host :  hi and welcome to our new show  exotic animal kingdom  a program geared toward introducing animals to the young and old .  in today ' s show  our young  but experienced  guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons .  welcome  joshua .   [ thank you very much .  ]  now  joshua  i must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book .  what exactly is a bearded dragon ? ", "guest :  well  here .  why don ' t you hold on to bert   [ oh  .  .  .  wow !  ]  while i talk about him .   [ okay ]  bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of australia  and this is one of several species that survived in that climate .  today  beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the us . ", "dragonprogram host :  okay .  and  so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon ?  i mean  can you raise one as a family pet ? ", "guest :  bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures . ", "program host :  yeah  this one seems quite friendly . ", "guest :  you just need to know how to care for them . ", "program host :  well  what are some of the things you should keep in mind ? ", "guest :  first  you need to have the right supplies :  some kind of enclosure  .  .  . ", "program host :  like  like a cage or something like that . ", "guest :  yeah .   [ okay ]  a full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp  [ okay ]   branches and rocks to climb on and bask on  a food or water dish  and something to line bottom of the cage . ", "program host :  okay  well  let ' s get down to some the basics .  what are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon ?  it sounds like a very carnivorous beast .  perhaps  uh  they eat fiery mexican tacos or something like that . ", "greensguest :  no  bearded dragons are omnivores .  .  . ", "program host :  now  omnivores ?  what exactly is that ? ", "guest :  uh  creatures that eat insects  vegetable  and greens  the leafy parts of plants and their stems . ", "program host :  okay .  you mean like  for example  carrots or something like that for example .   [ yeah ]  okay . ", "guest :  young dragons like bert can be fed small crickets twice a day  along with some greens and shredded vegetables .   [ okay .  ]  and then as your dragon grows  you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables .   [ alright .  ]  and you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth . ", "program host :  okay  and what about water ?  uh  what kind of needs do they have for that ? ", "guest :  well  since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions  they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat  so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water .   [ okay .  ]  you also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish .  whatever you do  but sure to keep the cage dry   [ okay .  ]  or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick . ", "guest :   [ okay .  ]   and finally  you mentioned about lighting earlier .  what do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy ? ", "baskguest :  having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies .  first  they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet  ( uv )  bulb  .  .  . ", "program host :  now  is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned ?  okay . ", "guest :   .  .  .  to absorb rays  [ okay .  ]   vital to the production of certain vitamins   [ okay .  ]  and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process . ", "program host :  now  what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area ? ", "guest :  like ninety to a hundred degrees . ", "program host :  okay  and i don ' t think they need sun tan lotion  right ?   [ no ]  . ", "program host :  okay  uh  so  perhaps then  i could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight ?  would that work ? ", "guest :  well  actually  you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight ;  however  putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight won ' t be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a uv bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need . ", "program host :  wow !  i didn ' t know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that .  well  thanks very much for joining us today  joshua . ", "guest :  my pleasure .
