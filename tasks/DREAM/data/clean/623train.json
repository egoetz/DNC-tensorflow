[["b :  i don ' t know if we ' ll be able to spare a whole day at the ocean park .  we ' ve only got four days in hong kong  remember . ", "a :  oh right  well  in that case  i ' d advise you to get there early .  it opens at 1 0 o ' clock in the morning on weekdays .  look  i think i ' ve got a plan of the place somewhere .  let me see .  .   yes  here we are .  you can have this . ", "b :  thanks . ", "a :  ok i ' ll show you .  let ' s start with the lower level .  see ?  here ?  you arrive by taxi or bus or whatever here  on the right  can you see ?  that ' s the bus terminal .  and you go in through the main entrance .  you could go to water world first but i think you ' d better miss that out as you ' re short of time  you said .  you see the cable cars ?  well  those long lines are the wires and the little circles are the cars going up and down to the next level .  well  walk past the cable car terminal  at the bottom of the plan  and bear right past the waterfall gardens .  actually  have a look in  there are ducks and other birds in the pool there - it ' s very pretty .  then you ' ll see some steps up on the left .  follow that path and you ' ll come to the centenary garden which is a good place to stop and take pictures if you ' ve got your camera .  then carry on until you ' re almost at the children ' s zoo .  right .  i wouldn ' t bother to visit the zoo if i were you  it takes quite a long time to walk round .  but i do recommend the  \" touch and feed \"  section opposite  as i said .  it ' s great fun for small children . ", "b :  ok  so we ' ll pay a visit there  and then what ? ", "a :  you could come back a different way past the chinese rock garden .  oh  that ' s lovely - do wander around if there ' s time .  then go down the steps to the otter pool - you can have a sit down there for a little while and watch the otters messing around in the water .  then back to the cable car terminal where you can catch a car to the upper level .  the journey takes about ten minutes  i suppose  it ' s quite a long way .  now if you look at the other plan  the one for the upper level  you ' ll see where you arrive . ", "b :  is this the terminal here in the bottom left hand comer ? ", "a :  yes  that ' s right .  the fun fair is in the top left hand corner .  can you see ?  with  \" the dragon \"  i was telling you about  and  \" the octopus \"  and  \" the spider \"  .  do you think you ' ll want to go to that ? ", "b :  um  well  i think the children are a bit too young really  but they might enjoy watching other people . ", "a :  ok .  well  if you ' re feeling quite hungry by the time you arrive  which you probably will be  why not have a snack in the chinese restaurant next to the terminal ?  when you ' ve finished your lunch  i would go to the coral reef first .  it ' s that little building on the left hand side .   \" that ' s where you can see fish and other underwater creatures in a kind of natural habitat . ", "b :  right .  that sounds interesting . ", "a :  it ' s lovely .  after that  walk up to  \" the dragon \"  and watch people being really scared !  then you could come down to the ocean theater  which is just to the left of the center of the plan -  and see a performance of dolphins or maybe the killer whale .  you ' ll have to check the times for that .  there ' s one at two o ' clock  i think .  i ' m not sure about the high diving  but you may be able to see that as well .  if there ' s time  you could also carry on to the fight and have a look at wave cove .  and finally  if you ' re not too exhausted by then you could return to the lower level by using the famous escalator .  you ' d be finished by 3 : 3 0 or 4 at the latest . ", "b :  right  well  thanks for all your advice .  urn  we ' ll send you a postcard ! ", "a :  i ' ll look forward to it .
