", "m :  we ' re getting ready for our entire staff to return early from vacation tomorrow whereupon we are going to move into temporary classrooms .  and the other buildings that did not burn are being de - smoked .  as to the cause of the fire  all we know is that we were having trouble with the pilot lights since we bought the stove in july and it had been serviced three times .  well  as a matter of fact  we think it was a malfunctioning stove that may have caused the fire .  nothing definite yet has been determined . ", "w :  have you heard from other schools or other institutional users of this stove that have had the same problem ? ", "m :  no .  i wouldn ' t know anything more about the stove itself .  all i know is that this fire went up so quickly that there ' s been a suspicion about why it went up so quickly .  and it may be that there was a gas blast .  but  again  this has not been determined officially by anybody . ", "w :  i got you .  when do kids come back to school ? ", "m :  next monday  and we will be ready for them .  monday january 4 .  we ' re just extremely thrilled that no one was hurt and that ' s because of the fire fighters that were here  nine of them .  they ' re wonderful .
