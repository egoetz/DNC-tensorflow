", "w :  we hope that it will somehow help people to change their feelings about old age .  the  problem is that far too many of us believe that most old people are poor  lonely  and unhappy .  as a result  we tend to find old people  as a group  unattractive .  and this is very dangerous for our society . ", "m :  but surely we cannot escape the fact that many old people are lonely and many are sick .

", "m :  are people ' s mental abilities affected by old age ? ", "w :  certain changes do take place as we grow older  but this happens throughout life .  these changes are very gradual and happen at different times with different people  but  in general  if you know a person well in his middle age and have seen how he deals with events and problems  you will easily recognize him in an old age .
