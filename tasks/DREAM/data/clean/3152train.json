[["w :  are you free this evening ?  would you like to come with me to the international center ? ", "m :  i remember receiving their calendar of activities in my campus mailbox a week ago .  i didn ' t really look at it  though .  isn ' t that where they organize parties and trips for foreign students ? ", "w :  not only for foreign students .  the international center ' s activities are intended for all students .  they set up conversation tutorials for a variety of languages  and through the center ' s host family program  you can visit the home of a local family . ", "m :  now that you mention it  it would be nice to meet more people from this area .  i find the customs of this country really confusing sometimes .  but also there are times when i need to talk to people who come from other countries as i do .  i ' ll bet a lot of them feel the way i do . ", "w :  of course .  you are not the only person who is new around here .  take me .  my family lives 500 miles away from here .  that isn ' t another country  but it is a long distance .  the center is a good place for meeting people who can tell you how to get to know this city .  and if you ever feel lonely  you can go over there and find someone to chat with .  on weekday nights  they don ' t close until 11 : 30 . ", "m :  i guess it ' s worth visiting .  did you say you are going there tonight ? ", "w :  uh - huh  to a coffee hour at eight .
